# Predicting-minimum-daily-temperatures-in-Melbourne


This project focuses on predicting the **minimum daily temperatures in Melbourne, Australia**, using historical time series data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can forecast future minimum temperatures based on past observations.

## 📈 Project Overview

- **Problem**: Time series forecasting of minimum daily temperatures.
- **Location**: Melbourne, Australia.
- **Data**: Daily minimum temperatures from 1981 to 1990.
- **Techniques**: Time series analysis, feature engineering, machine learning (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest), and deep learning (e.g., LSTM).

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulbrabban/daily-minimum-temperatures-in-melbourne
- **File**: `daily-min-temperatures.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `Date`: Date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format
  - `Temp`: Minimum temperature in degrees Celsius


## 📌 Features

- Visualizes temperature trends and seasonality
- Implements time-based train-test split
- Supports classical ML models and LSTM-based neural networks
- Saves trained models for reuse
